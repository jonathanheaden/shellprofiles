## Setup
- First install chocolatey from https://chocolatey.org/packages?q=git
- Install git by running `choco install git` in the chocolatey folder

## Markdown
- Readme files are written in localised variants of Markdown (github & bitbucket use versions close to the original)
- Markdown was invented by John Gruber - he has documented the synthax here: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
- Take a look at Markdownpad (Windows) http://markdownpad.com/news/2013/introducing-markdownpad-2/  as a viewer/editor of markdown
- All repos should have a README file

## Git commands
There is a cheatsheet on github that should mostly work with bitbucket
https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf

- `git clone <URL to Repo>` Copy a repo from the web to a local directory 
- `git add .` Add all files in the directory to the repo  
- `git rm <file>`  remove a file from the repo   
- `git commit -m "Mesage"` commit to the repo with a log message
- `git push -u origin master` prompts for your password then pushes to the website  
- `git init` initialise a new repo
- `git pull` downloads the latest updates from the wbesite and updates your local copy
